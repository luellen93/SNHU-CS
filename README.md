# SNHU-CS
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The grocery store project takes in a text file that contains a list of produce that has been purchased. The project consists of a few different ways to display the information so that it is easy to determine how much of each item is included in the lsit. This project can easily be adapted to read any text file and display the information in a digestable way.
   
2. What did you do particularly well?
    Something I did particularly well in this project was keeping my code separated into .h and .cpp files so that it is easier to see how the code functions and what each method does.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
     A place where I can enhance my code is the histogram method. I can implement a method that takes in a desired character to display instead of '*'. This way the user can display the histogram however they would prefer. Another thing I could also improve is passing the map created by reference so that I avoid altering the main map at any point. This will allow me to avoid any issue with unwanted changes.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
     The piece of code I found to be the most challenging was the creation of the map after reading the .txt file. Maps wasn't something that had a ton of information in ZyBooks so I had to do a lot of research using stack overflow and geeks for geeks. The way I eventually overcame this challenge was but reading about how maps worked in c++ and slowly building code to make sure I was created the map right and then iterating through it correctly.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
     The skills that will be transferable to other projects was my ability to learn about a new concept in the coding language and then implement it. This required me to test my code often and build my code incrementally.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
     The way I made this code maintainable, readable, and adaptable was by using inherited files and keeping my main file very short. This allows me to only need to change a few things in my .h or .cpp file to make large changes to the whole code base. Also, the main file is more readable due to calling from methods that are declared and defined elsewhere.
